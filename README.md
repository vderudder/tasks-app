# Welcome to Tasks app!

This is my first React app ever created after learning React basics in Platzi Day.

It's a classic To Do app that allows you to add and delete tasks. 

Also, you can complete them by hitting the âœ” button next to the task.

It has localStorage support so you won't lose your tasks when refreshing the website, they will always be there for you.

## Project insights

ðŸ”¸ It's developed entirely with React

ðŸ”¸ I added custom and responsive CSS

In mobile, some CSS styles don't appear as intended and I still have to fix them.
